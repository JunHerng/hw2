# HW2

This repository contains the code for HW2 for NUS PC5210.

## Code

* `forward_euler_approx.py` - Basic forward Euler approximation.
* `separable_hamiltonian.py` - Hamiltonian is treated as separable and half-steps are taken.
* `convoluted_hamiltonian.py` - Half-step and quarter steps. Convoluted is meant in the literal rather than mathematical sense.
